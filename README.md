#Connect Four
--
###Overview
--
For Project 1 I am working on creating a connect four game. The objective of the game is to get four of the same pieces in a row. The first player should make their move and will have a red piece. Player 2 will make their move with a black piece. Once the winning combination is competed the game will end. If no one gets four in a row, then the game will end in a draw.
